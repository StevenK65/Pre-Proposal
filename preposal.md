# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Proof checker - A program to check whether a given proof in sentential, and possibly predicate logic, is valid.

Automated proof machine - A program to automatically prove simple logical statements (not sure how complex this would be and if it's feasible).

Graph visualizer - A program to create and visualize edge/node graphs (not super familiar with graph theory)

Guitar tab transcriber - A program that listens to a guitar riff or song and automatically transcribes the notes played

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I'm in pure math/philosophy, so if there's any other final project ideas that might relate to these (or could be added to the above) then please suggest some. I'm especially interested in set theory, and also chess.
